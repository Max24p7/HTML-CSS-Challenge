# HTML-CSS-Challenge

## Description

This project was part of the first unit of bootcamp.  Our goal was to refactor code by adding accessibility features to the provided code such as alt text, comments, and semantic HTML.

## Usage

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
